* Gmail2Gcal
Gmail2Gcal allows you to convert [[http://bit.ly/IQM5AK][Gmail]] mail messages into [[http://bit.ly/IQNmYx][Gcal]] events. The events can simply be used to keep a timeline of emails or you can set a reminder on the events to notify you of the email via you calendar notification mechanism. This is particularly useful if you have a smartphone that synchronizes with your Gcal calendars.

* Installation Requirements
- A Gmail and Gcal account.
- This has been written and tested under [[http://bit.ly/KfxHFQ][Ubuntu 10.4]] Linux. It should work on other operating systems but [[http://bit.ly/Kfy0R4][YMMV]]. If you are on [[http://bit.ly/II1ozK][Windows]], my advice is that you to upgrade to [[http://bit.ly/II1rvz][Linux]]. If you can't or just plain won't to upgrade to Linux, installing [[http://bit.ly/II16ce][Cygwin]] should allow a successful installation of Gmail2Gcal. Once again, YMMV.
- Either a working [[http://bit.ly/Kfyu9Z][crontab]] system or another mechanism to execute IMAPFilter at regular time intervals. It should be possible, and possibly more efficient, to use IMAPFilter's "become_daemon" command to schedule execution of Gmail2Gcal. I did not do this as I found using a cron job easier than using "become_daemon". See [[https://github.com/lefcha/imapfilter/blob/master/samples/extend.lua][extend.lua]] in IMAPFilter's repository for an example of "become_daemon". Contributions in this area would be most appreciated.
- Installation of the [[http://bit.ly/IHZM9l][GoogleCL]] Google Command Line interface program. Installation is well [[http://bit.ly/IHZT4E][documented]] and relatively straightforward. GoogleCL is supported on most operating systems.
- Either a [[http://bit.ly/II0Tpm][bash]] shell or perhaps an [[http://bit.ly/IHZT4E][sh]] shell. Note that this has not been tested with an sh shell.
- If you will be setting reminders with Gmail2Gcal, it is preferable to install Gmail2Gcal on a computer that is permanently connected to the internet.
- Familiarity with Gmail [[http://bit.ly/Lx0qYS][labels]] and [[http://bit.ly/Lx0qYS][filters]].

* Installation
While no step is complex, there are several steps required to install Gmail2Gcal. Skipping any step will leave you with a non-working installation.

** Installing Bash (likely only for Windows users)
1) If you don't bash installed, install [[http://bit.ly/II16ce][Cygwin]] if you are on Windows or directly install bash from its [[http://bit.ly/JbQmzE][homepage]].

** Install GoogleCL 
1. Follow the [[http://bit.ly/IHZT4E][documentation]] for installing GoogleCL.

** TODO Gmail Setup
1. Make sure you have a Gmail account.
1. Create a new label in Gmail that you will use for emails that you want to have processed by Gmail2Gcal. I recommend the label /_Gmail2Gcal/ though you can choose a different one. I use the leading underscore (_) to cause the label to appear near the top of Gmail's label list.
1. Configure filters TODO

** Gcal Setup
1. Make sure that you have a Gcal account.
1. If you wish to use a calendar other than your default Gcal calendar for Gmail2Gcal events, create that calendar in Gcal. I use a calendar name /Reminders/ though that is just my personal choice.
1. If you are not using your default calendar, edit the /gmail2gcal/ shell script and follow the directions at the top of the file for specifying which calendar should be used.
